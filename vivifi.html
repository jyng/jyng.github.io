  <h3>Building a more efficient for sexual case management</h3>

  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>
    The processing of a sexual assault case involves many moving parts.
    First, there is the SANE(Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner) Nurse that examines the victim to begin the case.
    The results of the examination are then sealed inside of Sexual Assault Kit(SAK).
    These kits then go through a process of medical examination that may help identify the assailant and provide evidence in a trial. After the SAK gets processed, the case is assigned to an investigator to pursue the case.
    The investigator finds the assailant, presents them in trial, and concludes the case. Sounds great, right?
  </p>
  <p>
    However, due to funding issues, most cases never get pursued. Most of the time, SAKs don’t even reach the e
    xamination facilities and thus an investigator can never really begin his work.
  </p>
  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>
    Because the crux of this problem is the transfer of information,
    we tried to make it simple for the case information to be as transient as possible.
  </p>
  <h3>Creating A Case</h3>
  <p>
    A case usually begins with a SANE Nurse, so we let a SANE Nurse start the case with the victim’s information. However, the SANE Nurse has some legal limitations:

    They cannot edit the case after it has been submitted
    They cannot view other cases
  </p>
    <p>Because they only have instance to submit the case, we have a “Review” button to ensure that they entered the information correctly. 

We have a “User Type” that ensures that a “SANE Nurse” type may only create new records.
  </p>
  <h3>Investigating A Case</h3>
  <p>
    After a case has been submitted, the case shows up on the dashboard(which only the investigator may see).
    The investigator can then proceed to look through each case and fill out the information they’ve collected. 
    Once an investigator presses “Complete”, an automatic email is sent to the victim that updates them on the progress of their case.
  </p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    We built this on a snowy weekend in Tahoe so it’s still a small application, but we think we tackled some of the major hurdles:

  Investigators are unable to proceed the case due to SAK backlogs
  Victims never hear back about any updates on their case
  </p>
