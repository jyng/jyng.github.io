#Hey, thanks for stopping by!

This is my current portfolio. I believe a large part of design is communication, so this is an honest effort towards practicing that skill. Feel free to use this template for your portfolio.

##Tech stuff
Built on Github Pages using [Basscss](http://basscss.com). There's some Jekyll here as well (loosely from [Heather](http://jxnblk.com/Heather/)).
