## Identity Design

I really struggled a lot through the brand identity process. It was mainly hard because the topic is so personal. To best represent the subject, we needed a brand to show to nascent aspect of Asian-American culture. So the identity would have an evolving aesthetic rather than one that's stagnant.

## Design

I did all the photography, design, and development of the site. I worked with a friend to interview and transcribe all the interviews. Site is being released Summer 2017.
