## Background
I started Meiru to answer questions I've had around Asian-American identity. But also to see if others shared the same curiosity. As much as Asian-American identity is a personal fascination, I was careful to imbue my own opinions into it. For this to be of meaningful value to others, it has to be a space for others. Albeit random, I hope that this could be helpful for anyone struggling with these issues.

## Identity Design

I went through several identities trying to narrow down a single logotype that would capture the essence of Asian-American culture. I came out with a handful of logotypes (shown below). While discussing the logotype with some colleagues, I realized that I was approaching the problem wrong. I couldn't possibly distill a nascent culture that's still finding it's voice into a single logotype.

I realized that the best approach is to have the visual identity evolve over time. This not only gives the identity fluidity, but I believe it's also the most respectful intention.
I struggled, but ultimately enjoyed the process of creating an identity from scratch.

## Website Design

I did all the photography, design, and development of the site. I worked with a colleague to plan, interview and transcribe all the content. If anyone out there has ever done transcription, I now I have the utmost respect for you.
