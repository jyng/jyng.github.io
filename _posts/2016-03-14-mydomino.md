## Redesigning the main website using a design sprint exercise

### About
Our website was in need of an overhaul, so I suggested using a design sprint exercise
to facilitate the design decisions. I included our developer,concierge coordinator,
and marketing director.

### Kickoff
I started the process by gathering the competitor's user flows and put that side by side
with our current design. This way, I can make sure that participants all start on the
same foot.
