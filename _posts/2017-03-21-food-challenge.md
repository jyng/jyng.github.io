## Background

MyDomino's mission is to help people reduce their carbon impact. But getting people to reduce their carbon impact is hard because there are so many moving parts: Going solar, reducing food waste, switching to renewable energy â€” the options are varied.

We decided to build out a guided path that makes the whole process of reducing carbon emissions easy and fun.

## The Product

Our product is divided into 3 different categories: Food, Transportation, Energy.

We started with food first because it was something that a lot of users were curious about. We figured we could use that curiosity to our advantage and build repertoire before moving onto larger/other categories.

In terms with how it works, it's food tracking but measured in carbon footprint. We realized early on that many people are curious about reducing their carbon footprint, but they don't know much about it. Our product prioritized the learning of the relationship of food and carbon footprint, while using competition to create a compelling experience.

## My Role
I was responsible for designing the entire web app from ideation to implementation. I also helped gather user research, facilitate key product decisions, and helped build out the CSS architecture.

## Wireframes

I started by organizing Actions and Information into specific hierarchies and then iterated in a Crazy 8s fashion to quickly generate ideas.
I then took the best ideas so see how well they held up on the screen.

## Visual Design
We decided on a graph UI that placed focus on a user's food impact progress. Below the progress tile, we also offered other resources such as helpful articles and local events in the area.

## Feedback

I suggested that we should do some user interviews even if the product wasn't fully functional to test our assumption. I supported user research by distilling findings into insights.

Here are some insights we found:
- Measurement for carbon dioxide wasn't a clear indicator of how well they were doing
- We had a hidden affordance in the graph UI. There is no perceivable information for a user to act upon (The graphs numbers were meaningless to a user).
- The gauge's relationship with their food selection was ambiguous

## Solution

My product manager suggested that showing the weekday a user has completed would help solve our affordance issue. I volunteered to implement it as the engineers were busy solving a large back-end issue.
While building the Weekday UI, I reasoned that we move the graph into a results view. A graph at the end of flow would have more value for users.

In the food view, after a user finishes food input flow, they are brought back to the dashboard.

## Style Guide & CSS Architecture

### Style Guide
While building the product, I documented our design patterns into a style guide so as the product grew our team was able make decisions quickly and build the product consistently.

### CSS Architecture
When I first joined the company, it was all legacy code leftover from various contractors. I led the restructuring of the entire CSS stack (concepts borrowed from Tachyons/Basscss). I focused on readability and consistency that allowed our CSS to evolve gracefully.
