## Background

MyDomino's mission is to help people reduce their carbon impact. But getting people to reduce their carbon impact is hard because there are so many moving parts: Going solar, reducing food waste, switching to renewable energy â€” the options are varied.

We decided to build out a guided path that makes the whole process of reducing carbon emissions easy and fun.

## The Product

Our product is divided into 3 different categories: Food, Transportation, Energy.

We started with food first because it was something that a lot of users were curious about. We figured we could use that curiosity to our advantage and build repertoire before moving onto larger/other categories.

In terms with how it works, it's food tracking but measured in carbon footprint. We realized early on that many people are curious about reducing their carbon footprint, but they don't know much about it. Our product prioritized the learning of the relationship of food and carbon footprint, while using competition to create a compelling experience.

## My Role
I was responsible for designing the entire web app from ideation to implementation.
- Supported my product manager with user research.
- Collaborated with our 2 developers on front-end development.
