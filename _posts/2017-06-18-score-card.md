## Product Goals
After releasing Food Challenge, the MyDomino team learned that there was still a missing piece in our product. When a user completes the flow, there's no reward for them to return. Food Challenge, in its most basic form, is a utilitarian product (It tracks food consumption). Our product was lacking in product strategy and variable reward.

I focused on researching on the motivations of the self-driven and the climate change curious. I used those insights to design a solution that capitalizes on motivations.

## Creating the Variable Reward
I conducted a series of exploratory interviews with environmental bloggers and clean energy activists. These conversations unveiled 2 striking insights:
-  The Curious (climate change curious) felt overwhelmed by the complexity of environment
- The Self-Driven found it hard to spread their motivation without being pestering or intrusive

I co-led product meetings about these insights that led us to conceptualizing The Score Card: A representation of one's carbon impact. Then,  Users are can more easily conceptualize an abstract concept (their carbon impact). It also becomes an easier topic to talk about.

However, having a score isn't a powerful variable reward. Our next step was to leverage the Self-Driven and The Curious to build on each other. Empowering the Self-Driven's clean energy actions, while educating The Curious. We added a layer of social competition that would help users learn better habits.

## Pushing it Further

Having social competition keeps users thinking about their carbon impact in a fun way, but we wanted to people to get excited about carbon impact. In trying to capture this, I designed a "surprise" screen to congratulate the user for increasing their rank. Additionally, we added a taunt button to add mischief to the competition. We were wary of creating a dark pattern, so we added it in our user testing before building it. The feedback was 50/50, so we decided to punt it for the next release.
