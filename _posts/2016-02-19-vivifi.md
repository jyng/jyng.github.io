## Problem


The processing of a sexual assault case involves many moving parts. First, there is the SANE (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner) Nurse that examines the victim to begin the case. The results of the examination are then sealed inside of Sexual Assault Kit (SAK).

These kits then go through a process of medical examination that may help identify the assailant and provide evidence in a trial. After the SAK gets processed, the case is assigned to an investigator to pursue the case. The investigator finds the assailant, presents them in trial, and concludes the case. Sounds great, right?

However, due to funding issues, most cases never get pursued. Most of the time, SAKs don’t even reach the examination facilities and thus investigators rarely have adequate materials to pursue a case.

## Solution

The biggest problem was simply transferring information from one person to another. We tried to bridge the gaps between people and make the process as smooth as possible.

### Creating a record

SANE Nurses usually begin and create records, but they have some legal limitations on their access of information:

- They cannot edit the record after it has been submitted

- They cannot view other records

To account for these limitations, we decided to separate "SANE Nurse" and "Investigator" types where SANE Nurses can only create new records and Investigators can create and view records.

Because SANE Nurses can only create new records, we have a “Review” button to help them confirm that they've entered the information accurately.

### Investigating a case
After a case has been submitted, the case shows up on the dashboard (which only the investigator may see). The investigator can then proceed to look through each case and fill out the information they’ve collected.

Once an investigator presses "Complete", an automatic email is sent to the victim that updates them on the progress of their case.

## Conclusion
We built this on a snowy weekend in Tahoe so it’s still a small application, but we think we overcame two big obstacles:

- **Investigators are unable to proceed the case due to SAK backlogs**

- **Victims rarely hear back about any updates on their case**

## Lessons Learned

### Designing in the Browser

At first, it was odd that I had not opened Sketch at all, but I soon found out that I was building things faster than I would have in Sketch. I used a [Tachyons spacing module](http://tachyons.io/) on top of a [Bootstrap theme](https://bootswatch.com/paper/) where Tachyons' atomic classes really showed big gains without conflicting the Bootstrap CSS (It's amazing what margin and padding can do alone). I left the project learning how small utility classes reduces the friction for designers to contribute to the actual product.

### UX Freebies from MEAN Stack

We had some disagreements about using MEAN stack vs Rails, but ultimately chose MEAN. Coming from working with Rails, I now understand why we chose MEAN. Take a look at this interaction:


Because MEAN processes most of it’s information client-side, we can minimize clicks to help users achieve their goals easier. With our heavy focus on input fields, choosing MEAN enabled us to make a simpler application with less flows.


### Using User Stories to Manage Scope

The largest problem with hack projects is deciding what can be reasonably built in 1-2 days. By using user stories, we were able to organize and complete features efficiently while keeping a holistic view of the scope.
