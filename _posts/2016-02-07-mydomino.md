## Redesigning marketing website through a design sprint exercise

##About
Domino is a committed to helping people contribute to a more sustainable planet while saving them money . Concierges assess homeowners energy habits and recommend clean energy products that can help them save money.

## Problem

After a conversation with a concierge, homeowners tend to drop off and forget about the recommendations the concierge made.

## Concept

We decided to build a dashboard that would allow users to revisit their recommendations and check off recommendations they’ve completed. On the surface, the dashboard helps homeowners visualize their progress. On the other side, the dashboard also helps concierges manage and track homeowners’ performance.


### Iteration 1

v0. The previous design was just an (Amazon iframe) with a bit copy for context. It was a limiting experience for homeowners, not to mention some usability issues.

v1. I designed the customer dashboard that allowed

## Testing & Validation

### Iteration 2

We realized that our recommendations split into two categories: Actions and Products.

### Focusing on the Concierge

As we completed our outward facing product, we realized that the dashboard offered limited value to concierges. 

## Result

## Lessons Learned

Taking over development makes a better relationship between design and development

Using Sketch and Zeplin required a lot of micromanage work on my part to seamlessly create the design I wanted. By taking over the CSS, I reduced the documentation and workload on engineering.
