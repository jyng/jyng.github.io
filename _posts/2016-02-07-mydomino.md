## Redesigning main website to increase lead conversion

Our website was in need of an overhaul, so I decided to take a inclusive approach to redesign the website. There were two main goals I wanted to achieve: validate our assumptions and update visual identity. I used GV's Design Sprint as a model for our design sprint.

### Day 1:Understand

#### Existing Solutions
I started the process by gathering competitor design flows and put that side by side
with our current design. This way, I can make sure participants all start on the
same foot. This also helps eliminate repeating ideas that might come up during sketching.

#### Initial Testing
Before the design sprint, I also ran some first impression tests on the old website to bring to
the kickoff. This lended some insight

### Day 2: Sketching
Sketching removes a lot of personal attachment to an idea and places it into a picture. People are then having arguments on "this idea" rather than "who's idea".

#### Crazy Eights to Storyboards
We used Crazy Eights as a rapid sketching exercise to get everyone cranking out ideas quickly. We then choose our strongest ideas and created storyboards out of that.

### Design

#### Prototype

After sketching, there came about a flow that resonated with all us. We made an assumption that if users understood what we were offering, they would be more likely to become a lead. Our prototype consists of having a multiple step process that guides the user through questions. We found that this process would provide concierges with more specificity on users.

### Testing & Learning

With our prototype I took it through a 5-second test to see what impression people had about the website. The results were overwhelmingly on track of what we had assumed.
