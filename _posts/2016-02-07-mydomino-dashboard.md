## Building a better way to manage homeowners' path towards clean energy

Domino is a committed to helping people contribute to a more sustainable planet while saving them money . Concierges assess homeowners utility habits and recommend clean energy products that can help them save money.

##Problem

After a concierge makes the recommendations, it’s extremely difficult to help homeowners achieve those recommendations. How would homeowners communicate that they’ve completed recommendations?

##Concept

We decided to build a dashboard that would allow users to revisit their recommendations and check off recommendations they’ve completed. On the surface, the dashboard helps homeowners visualize their progress. On the other side, the dashboard also helps concierges manage and track homeowners’ performance.


###Iteration 1

v1.The design began with using an Amazon iframe to see how users would respond to this new product. 

v2. I then moved the design to align better with our brand and provide a consistent experience across all our user interactions.

##Testing & Validation

###Iteration 2

We realized that our recommendations split into two categories: Actions and Products.

###Focusing on the Concierge

As we completed our outward facing product, we realized that the dashboard offered limited value to concierges. 

##Result

##Lessons Learned

Taking over development makes a better relationship between design and development

Using Sketch and Zeplin required a lot of micromanage work on my part to seamlessly create the design I wanted. By taking over the CSS, I reduced the documentation and workload on engineering.
