## Building a better way to manage homeowners' path towards clean energy

## About
Domino is a committed to helping people contribute to a more sustainable planet.
Concierges assess homeowners utility habits and recommend clean energy products that can help them save money.

## Problem

After a concierge makes the recommendations, it’s extremely difficult to help homeowners achieve those recommendations. How would homeowners communicate that they’ve completed recommendations? How would concierges help homeowners succeed in switching to renewable energy.

## Concept

We decided to build a dashboard that would allow users to revisit their recommendations and check off recommendations they’ve completed. On the surface, the dashboard helps homeowners visualize their progress. On the other side, the dashboard also helps concierges become more efficient in managing homeowner activity.


### Iteration 1

v0. The design began with a simple Amazon iframe on a webpage. As I researched more into Amazon iframe, it actually offered very limited capabilities.

v1. So, I decided that we would leverage the Amazon API to build our own product database. This would offer a heftier service while providing a consistent brand experience. The first iteration of the dashboard is shown below:

### Exploring the 2nd Iteration
I conducted unmoderated user interviews to gain insight on how our users were using our new product. 2 common pain points came up:

## User Testing

For the concierge side, testing was simply validating that what I designed was contingent with concierge expectations.

On the homeowner side, I conducted 5 unmoderated user interviews to validate that what we were building provided value to homeowners.
