# Increase paid membership sign-ups for Spiritual Workout

## My Role
I led summative research to synthesize our findings into insights. I worked closely with our user research lead to design the layout. For the wireframes, I established the visual language amongst the team.

## Problem
Meeting with our client Steven was a great way for us to understand his business more. He explained that his website just launched and that he wasn't looking for major changes. His main problem was that he wasn't getting as much paid sign-ups as he had hoped for. After the meeting, we saw two main challenges:

1. How might we improve Steven's website without doing major changes?

2. How might we measure that our design increase paid sign-ups?

###What is Spiritual Workout?

Most people would answer Yoga (we did too), but in actuality it was something different.

**“Spiritual”** refers to the list of concepts that our client has created. The concepts are a set of mantras that help guide the user through a certain problem (depression, financial issues, unmet aspirations, etc.). **“Workout”** is referring to the exercise of the mind. Put together, Spiritual Workout is the constant practice of concepts to help guide the user through struggles.

Into every project, teams always have assumptions about the problem.  It was important to recognize these assumptions before we dove into research. We grouped our assumptions so that we can validate and test them when we were conducting research.

After recognizing our assumptions, we realized that we all assumed that the website had **low user engagement** and that it was **difficult for users to navigate the website**.

###How might we test our assumptions?
To bridge the gap of our understanding of users, we tested our assumptions in the hopes that we could drive more empathy.

**Assumption 1: Low user engagement**

Website analytics is a great tool to understand more about user engagement. However, we were struggling to understand the jargon in our report. Thankfully, one of our members had a lot of experience with this and was able to break it down for us.

After we all understood the data, I suggested to frame this assumption into a problem statement:

*If returning visitors were **below 20%** and the bounce rate was **above 50%**, than the site needed a redesign. By utilizing Google Analytics to measure the traffic of the site, we were able to show to the client the source of low user engagement.*

**Assumption 2: Difficult to Navigate**

We conducted interviews to gain an understanding of whether if users had the pain points we had assumed.

In all our interviews, users talked passionately about their own experience with spirituality, but when introduced to the site, we heard challenges.

##“I need to have clear space for spirituality and this website doesn’t give me that space”

##“I don’t have time to read through all the text”

###What can we conclude from research?
After doing our initial research, we collected an abundant amount of information. It wasn't immediately clear what all this scattered information represented. So, we would need to synthesize our research and transform our findings into a design goal.

I believe that tackling research should be an extremely collaborative experience. For affinity mapping, we synthesized bits of our individual findings into post-it notes before beginning our session. I then played as a facilitator to map the post-it notes depending on their similarity.  After awhile, post-it notes began to cluster and we came to a consensus on what to label that cluster. Those clusters then represent the trends of our findings.

Through affinity mapping, we are able to piece together our research to find trends and insights. These insights will serve as a guide to creating our user groups.

###Why create user groups?
We created 2 labels to differentiate the different type of users from our research. The Enlightened is the experienced practitioner embodies spirituality in their life and encourages others to join them. The Light User is a person who derives effectiveness from spirituality and is more reserved than The Enlightened.

By creating user groups, we are able to establish a foundation of empathy when we are designing. We can ask questions like, " Does this user flow fit well The Light Users?"

##Design
Sketching as a collaborative exercise is a great way to show design decisions and make improvements. With our user groups in mind, we sketched out our ideas together in a Design Studio format.

We established our user groups as empathy points and declared the problem we were trying to solve: simplify and prioritize information. We then diverged and sketched our individual solutions to the problem. After 5 minutes, we converged to critique each other's ideas. We then diverged again and improved our ideas based on critique. This process repeated another round where we voted on which idea solved the problem best.

###Designing the experience
Sketches are great for showing conceptual elements, but creating a cohesive experience requires wireframes that can demonstrate a website flow.

I focused on creating global styles for everyone to use by choosing the typography and color. I suggested designing in grayscale to avoid inconsistency. I noted that green may be used for call-to-actions.

I designed the "Membership" page, while other members designed the other pages. I then led the team to make sure global elements and information architecture was consistent.

##Measuring

After completing our designs, we tested our results with users and found that users were eager to sign-up but were still hesitant about paying for Spiritual Workout. We realized that users needed to have a clear grasp of benefits before committing to payment. With the fidelity of our wireframes we were able to increase overall sign-ups, but increasing paid sign-ups would require further iterations.

##Lessons Learned

###Redesign with a Reason
After presenting website analytics and user research, we were able to show why we needed make our changes to improve the website. We realized that by aligning business goals with user goals, clients can see why redesigns may be necessary.

This insight helped us establish a great working rapport early in the project. This later lead to a lot of client involvement in the design process.

###Understand Your Tools  
Before creating user groups, we were actually making personas. We struggled to understand why personas weren't working for us. We later realized that we focused too much on what a persona is rather that what it does.

Thankfully, we were able to modify personas, as an empathy tool, to create what we called a user group.

###Always Measure Results
After completing a project, it's important to understand how your design is impacting users. Unfortunately, our designs are not live, so we couldn't measure our results with existing or new customers. To increase paid sign-ups, the next step would be involve working with the marketing team for further iterations. We could then use web analytics to measure our results.
