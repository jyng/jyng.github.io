I’m a self-taught product designer with a background in Business. For the past 2 years, I was designing software to help people reduce their carbon footprint.
 I grew up in Fremont, California. In college, I applied design-thinking to build a computer center in Haiti. After college, I started building websites and designing apps for various clients.

Design mantras I believe in…
— Good ideas can come from anywhere
— Strong opinions; loosely held
— Diversity leads to better solutions

Current topics I’m interested in…
— Decentralized web and what it means for non-technical folks
— Education technology and it’s impact on self-learning

You can find me collecting links on Asian-American diaspora, making memes, or gathering visuals.
