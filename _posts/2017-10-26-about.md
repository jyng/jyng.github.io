{{about}}
I’m a self-taught product designer with a background in Business. For the past 2 years, I was designing & prototyping software to help people reduce their carbon footprint.

I grew up in Fremont, California. In college, I applied design&#8209;thinking to build a computer center in Haiti. After college, I started building websites and designing apps for various clients.

Design mantras I believe in…

- Good ideas can come from anywhere
- Strong opinions; loosely held
- Diversity leads to better solutions

Current topics I’m interested in…
- Decentralized web and what it means for non-technical folks
- Education technology and it’s impact on self-learning
- The balance between generalist vs specialist
