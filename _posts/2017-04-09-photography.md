# Introduction

I've been taking photos for about six years. Mostly on and off because I'll hit a creative block and just quit from mental fatigue.
Here are some pictures I've taken in the past my colleagues have said they liked.

As I took more photos, I became lost and overwhelmed. I felt like I was blindly following a style. This year, I decided to take photography more seriously and question why I take pictures.

# Present
It took awhile, but when I started questioning my intentionality, I began to see myself shooting with a different perspective.

When I create a photo, I am trying to capture the moment in it's entirety. As I kept practicing this process, conventional photography was no longer serving me anymore. My pictures didn't match my vision because the moment transcended a snapshot in time. So I began to wonder:

<p class="mono f4 mb4 mt0">"What would a photo beyond a snapshot of time look like?"</p>

A pleasing photography is a social construct. With careful attention to composition, color, and light, one can create something refreshing and beautiful.

I am still searching for my voice in photography, but the path ahead is clearer. I've bridged the gap between my imagination and my execution. And that is all that I truly ask for; masterful control of craft. With that said, I am not abandoning conventional photography. Portrait, Street, Landscape, etc all have their time and place.  But now, I am able to look at the world with a different perspective. And as photographers, isn't that all that we ask for?
