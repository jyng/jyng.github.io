# Introduction

I've been taking photos for about 6 years. Mostly on and off because I'll get stuck on a visual aesthetic and just quit from mental fatigue. I'll state that photography was just unfulfilling for me. Classic cognitive dissonance.

Another problem was what I was consuming. To find inspiration, I would browse endlessly through Instagram and VSCO in an effort to train my eye. Over time, this habit made me feel like my skills were stuck. This year, through some personal reasons, I decided to get over my photography slump.

Here are some pictures I've taken in the past (read: that I hate), but friends have said they liked.

I focused on trying to replicate the aesthetic I was consuming. It slowly but surely eroded my passion for photography. I was struggling to feel motivated to shoot because I didn't have any purpose for shooting. Now, I ask myself: "What are you trying to say?" before I shoot.

# Present
It took awhile, but when I started questioning my intentionality, I began to see myself shooting with a different perspective.

When I'm creating a photo, I anticipate how the subject will move and then take the photo accordingly. However, I've started to antipate multiple variations of composition. This increases infinitely till I'm seeing an image that's existing in different timelines but all at once. That's what I'm trying to capture.

I questioned what makes a picture a photo. I tried to craft a narrative for my subjects and express that through a snapshot. For the first time, I felt like I was expressing and not replicating. When I look back at my photos, they feel a lot more meaningful then my photos before. And isn't that all we're seeking? To find meaning in life?
