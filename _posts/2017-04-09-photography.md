# Introduction

I've been taking photos for about 6 years. Mostly on and off because I'll get stuck on a visual aesthetic and just quit altogether. I'll state that photography was just unfulfilling for me. Classic cognitive dissonance. Another problem was exposure ( I hate puns). The photography I was seeing on Instagram and VSCO made me question my photography. This year, through some personal reasons, I decided to get over my photography slump.

Here are some pictures I've taken in the past (read: that I hate), but other people have said were good.

#Present
In the past, I focused purely on actualizing the image of what I saw. Adhering strictly to the rules of photography. So much so that I avoided post-processing on principle.

It took awhile, but when I started questioning my intentionality, I began to see myself shooting in a different light ( I hate puns).

"What are you trying to say?"

This question haunts and inspires me at the same time.

Right now, I'm extremely drawn to fleeting small moments, technology-facilitated love, and humor. This new direction also pushed me into different shooting styles and post-processing.

Grain can be used to introduce nostalgia and longing.
